When you launch the app on your android phone, you can place each effect by tapping on the screen, each effect have his color code. The effect will appear later where you see the little pawn before tapping your screen. When all effects are placed just tap on the screen a last time and enjoy.
I know the UX is a bit clumsy. :(
